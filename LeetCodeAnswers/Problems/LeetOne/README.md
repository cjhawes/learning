# Two Sum

## Problem

Given an array of integers and a target value find the two distinct values in the array that produce said target.

## Solution

Loop over the array twice and return the numbers in the array at the two indices (if the indices are distinct from eachother).

## What I Did Right?

My first thought of a solution to this problem was pretty much by the book.

## What Could I Have Done Better?

The only improvement I can see between this and the book example is that I could have iterated 1 time fewer on the outer for loop. However I did consider this and put a check in the central if statement.
