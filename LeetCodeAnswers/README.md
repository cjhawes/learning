# LeetCode Answers

## Introduction

This C# Project is an attempt to solve every leetcode problem and learn algorithms, data structures and C# whilst doing so. My aim for this project is to improve my algorithm and data structure knowledge but also my problem solving skills. Completing this list of problems should ensure that I master these topics and any language I use in an attempt to solve them with. 

## Method

Starting with C# alone I will solve at least two problems daily, taking as long as I need to solve the problem. I will then review my answer alone to look at its efficiency and measure it against time complexity metrics. I will measure my attempts metrics and then compare to a known solution and it's metrics, documenting my learning and then documenting how I could improve my solution to hit the optimum solution.
